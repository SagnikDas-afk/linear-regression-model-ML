Linear regression is a supervised learning model that tries to find the best-fit line between input features (X) and output values (Y).
- First, the model is given some training data — a set of fixed input and output values.
- It plots a graph of the data and tries to find a line (or curve) that best fits the points.
- The model then takes random initial values for its parameters (slope and intercept).
- Using these, it predicts the outputs and compares them with the actual results.
- The difference between predicted and real values (called error or loss) is calculated.
- The machine learns by adjusting its parameters to reduce this error — this is done through an optimization process (like gradient descent).
- Gradually, the model learns to produce results that are very close to the real values.
